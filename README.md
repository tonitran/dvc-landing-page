To test and develop this page:

1. Set up Apache2 and a virtual host, with a mapped /etc/hosts address. (Or just stick to the defaults)
2. Copy all these files to the /var/www/html directory (or the directory of your virtual host).
3. Visit the address in your browser. Use developer mode or tools to debug and test!
