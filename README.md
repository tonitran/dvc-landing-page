# dvc-landing-page
This is the front end to the dvc-embedded program running on the Pi. The site runs on Apache and allows users many functions that can be executed by non-technical folks.

To test and develop this page:
1. Set up Apache2 and a virtual host, with a mapped /etc/hosts address. (Or just stick to the defaults)
2. Copy all these files to the /var/www/html directory (or the directory of your virtual host).
3. Visit the address in your browser. Use developer mode or tools to debug and test!
